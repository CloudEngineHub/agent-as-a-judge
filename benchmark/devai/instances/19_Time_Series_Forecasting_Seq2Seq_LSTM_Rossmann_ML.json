    "query": "Develop a sales forecasting system using a sequence-to-sequence model based on LSTM with the Rossmann Store Sales dataset, downloading it from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) and loading it in `src/data_loader.py`. Split the data into training and testing sets and save them in `src/data_loader.py`. Apply a sequence-to-sequence model based on `LSTM` and save the trained model under the `models/saved_models/` directory. Save the forecast results as `results/figures/forecast_results.png`. Save a comparison plot between the predicted and actual values to `results/figures/comparison_plot.png`. Generate an HTML report that includes the prediction results and comparison plots, with some interactive elements for exploring different forecast horizons, and save it as `results/report.html`. Ensure the model is tuned to capture seasonal trends in the sales data.",
