    "query": "Please create a PyTorch Perceptual Loss project for image style transfer (refer to this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155). You can build the Perceptual Loss Network using VGG16 in `src/model.py`. The project should combine content and style images, allow smooth adjustment of style intensity by tuning the weights of style loss and content loss, and save the stylized images in `results/figures/`. Additionally, log the processing time to `results/processing_time.txt`, and save the intermediate results of the style transfer process to `results/figures/intermediate_results.png`. For testing, input a famous content image (Mona Lisa) from [this link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/768px-Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg) and a famous style image (The Starry Night) from [this link](https://ia904705.us.archive.org/34/items/the-starry-night-vincent-van-gogh/The%20Starry%20Night%20-%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh/%21PREVIEW%21%20-%20The%20Starry%20Night%20-%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh.jpg), and generate a style-transfered image. Save the content, style, and style-transfered images to `data/content.jpg`, `data/style.jpg`, and `results/figures/`, respectively. The project should efficiently handle high-resolution images without excessive processing time.",
