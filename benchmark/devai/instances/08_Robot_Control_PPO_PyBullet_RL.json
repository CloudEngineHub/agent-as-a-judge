    "query": "I am seeking to implement a project which explores robotic arm control via reinforcement learning in the PyBullet simulation environment with the PPO algorithm. The PyBullet simulator should be imported and a related robotics environment should be loaded in `src/env.py`. The PPO algorithm should be implemented in `src/train.py`. The project should meticulously document the robot's final position, printing and saving it as `data/final_position.txt`. The training return trajectory should be graphed and saved as `results/figures/training_returns.png`. A sample of the robot's motion should be visualized and saved as `results/figures/robot_motion.gif`. A detailed environment setup and reward structure description should be provided in `src/env.py`. Please ensure that any issues with loading URDF files in PyBullet are clearly handled and documented, providing clear error messages or logging for debugging.",
