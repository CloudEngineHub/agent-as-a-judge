    "query": "Hi! I need help with a project that uses a Transformer model to solve math problems from the DeepMind Mathematics dataset. Please load the dataset and preprocessing it in `src/data_loader.py`. The preprocessing should parse and standardize the math expressions in a syntactically consistent way so the model can easily process them. Implement the Transformer in `src/model.py`. Also, tune the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the batch size in `src/train.py`, and save the training loss curve to `results/figures/training_loss_curve.png`. Sample and save some Transformer generated solutions in `results/sample_solutions.txt`. Using your model, create a simple interactive tool with Gradio or Streamlit in `src/interface.py` that can solve various user given math problems. Lastly, generate a report on how the model performs with different types of problems, including model accuracy, error analysis, and future improvement suggestions. Save it as `results/metrics/model_report.md`. Thanks in advance!",
