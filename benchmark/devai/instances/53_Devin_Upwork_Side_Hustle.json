    "query": "Hello, I am looking to make inferences with the models in this repository `https://github.com/mahdi65/roadDamageDetection2020`. The system should perform inferences using the models from the repository and save the results in `models/saved_models/`. Sample data should be downloaded and prepared for testing the models in `src/data_loader.py`. Inference should be performed using the provided models on the sample data in `models/saved_models/`. Visualized images showing the detections made by the models should be generated and saved in the `results/figures/` directory. Also, a performance report based on the model's detection results should be generated and saved as `results/metrics/model_performance_report.txt`.",
