Load the dataset and perform feature engineering, including feature selection and generation and handle missing data using mean imputation or interpolation in `src/data_loader.py`. Then, apply the Linear Regression model should be implemented in `src/model.py`. Visualize and save the correlation matrix in `results/figures/correlation_matrix.png` and the prediction results as a line plot with confidence intervals in `results/figures/prediction_results.png`. Finally, create a detailed report covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction results. Save the report in `results/weather_analysis_report.pdf`. The feature engineering process should be well-documented.",
