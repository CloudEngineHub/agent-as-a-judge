    "query": "I need to create a system for object tracking using a Siamese network and the OTB50 dataset. The OTB50 dataset should be loaded in `src/data_loader.py`. The system should include data augmentation steps such as rotation and scaling, performed in `src/data_loader.py`. Implement the Siamese network in `src/model.py`.  Hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, should be tuned in `src/train.py`. The tracking results should be saved as `results/tracking_results.txt`. Visualize the tracking results with OpenCV and save tracking videos under `results/videos/`. Additionally, create a comprehensive Markdown report that includes details of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process and save it as `results/object_tracking_report.md`. Ensure that the system can process new video sequences with minimal adjustments for flexible application. The Markdown report should include a section analyzing the impact of different hyperparameters on the tracking performance.",
