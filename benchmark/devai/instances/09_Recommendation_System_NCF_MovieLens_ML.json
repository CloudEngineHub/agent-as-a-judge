    "query": "Help me develop a system to recommend movies based on user ratings from the MovieLens dataset using a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) approach. First, load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets in `src/data_loader.py`. Next, implement the NCF approach and a matrix factorization baseline in `src/model.py`. Using these,  print an example of the top 10 recommendations for a test user the NCF approach and the baseline and save them to `results/metrics/top_10_recommendations.txt`. It would be good if these sample recommendations were meaningful given the test user. Evaluate the system's performance using RMSE, MAE, etc., and save the results of this evaluation to `results/metrics/evaluation_metrics.txt`. Try and ensure that there is robust path handling that can deal with missing directories and such when saving files.",
